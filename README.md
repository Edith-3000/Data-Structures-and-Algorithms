# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
<p>This project is meant to help beginners understand and code Data Structures and Algorithms
in C. This project strictly follows the book <strong>`Introduction to Algorithms` by Thomas H. Cormen</strong>.
Any beginners strugling with Data Structures and Algorithms are highly recommended to follow
the book. Most of the code is documented properly for beginner audiences to understand easily.
Minimum utilities and libraries are used in case the targeted audience ins't familiar with them.</p>
<p><h5> This project is still in development stage and needs more contributors. </h5></p>

## Algorithms Implemented
<p> Algorithms have been mostly implemented in C++ and partially documented. The algorithms implemented are:
<ol>
  <li>Insertion Sort.</li>
  <li> Heap Sort </li>
  <li> Quick Sort </li>
  <li> Randomized Quick Sort </li>
  <li> Counting Sort </li>
  <li> Merge Sort </li>
  <li> Selection Dort </li>
  <li> Bubble Sort </li>
  <li> Linear Search </li>
  <li> Binary Search </li>
  <li> Maximum Subarry Problem solved using brute forse, devide and concour and linear methods. </li>
  <li> Infix to Reverse Polish (postfix) using STACK in C</li>
  <li> Infix to Polish (prefix) using STACK in C</li>
  <li> Reverse Polish (postfix) to Polish (prefix) using STACK in C</li>
  <li> Reverse Polish (postfix) to Infix using STACK in C</li>
  <li> Polish (prefix) to Reverse Polish (postfix) using STACK in C</li>
  <li> Polish (prefix) to Infix using STACK in C</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> All the algorithms will be fully documented and implemented in C soon! </p>
  
## Data Structures Implemented
<p> All the Data Structures have been implemented in C. The implemented Data Structures are:
  <ol>
    <li> Stack (fully documented) </li>
    <li> Queue (undocumented) </li>
    <li> Heap (documented) </li>
    <li> Priority Queue (documented) </li>
    <li> Binary Search Trees (undocumented) </li>
    <li> Doubly Linked List (fully documented) </li>
    <li> Direct Address Tables (undocumented) </li>
    <li> Hash Tables (fully documented) </li>
  </ol>
</p>
